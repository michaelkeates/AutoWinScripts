A personal automated group of powershell scripts to download and install packages, disable services and debloat a new Windows 11 installation.
<br></br>
<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

I wanted a small, minimal set of scripts to setup a new Windows 11 installation that is 'hands free'. The purpose is to enable a few features and tweaks, download and install the latest software using Chocolatey as well the capability to update them in as quickly as possible with little to no input from the user. I listed a few authors' work below that I viewed to learn so all rights goes to them. Please note if you are going to use this script, I don't take any responsibility if something breaks and you are prepared to use this at your own risk! Also it is always good practice to view the source, to better understand what the script does. More notes and descriptions will be added in due time.
